        <blockquote>
            Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma â€“ which is living with the results of other people's thinking

            If you look at what you have in life, you'll always have more. If you look at what you don't have in life, you'll never have enough.

            If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor.
